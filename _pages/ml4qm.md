Together with [Barry Sanders](https://iqst.ca/people/peoplepage.php?id=4) (UCalgary), [Sourin Das](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/people/faculty/dps/sourin/#gsc.tab=0) (IISER, Kolkata), and [T S Mahesh](http://sites.iiserpune.ac.in/~mahesh.ts/homepage.htm) (IISER, Pune), I'm organizing a two-week workshop on Machine Learning for Quantum Matter (ML4QM) at [ICTS, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in). The most likely dates are mid-December 2026.

## Brief description of the program

The unprecedented progress in classical machine learning over the last two decades has pushed the boundaries of computational physics and physical sciences in general. One expects that, perhaps one day, quantum machine learning will be able to offer similar insights. One of the most promising applications of these techniques will be to further our understanding of the “quantum many-body problem”. From understanding the phase diagram of strongly correlated materials, to thermalization in closed quantum systems, one expects breakthroughs in every aspect of quantum many-body physics. The goal of this program is to bring together experts in classical and quantum machine learning, especially those with a focus on quantum many-body physics. This includes, but is not limited to, folks working on quantum learning theory, classical machine learning, tensor networks, classical simulations of quantum many-body systems, quantum diffusion models, quantum algorithms, information scrambling, to name a few.
