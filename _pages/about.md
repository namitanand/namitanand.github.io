$$\blacktriangleright$$ I'm a Staff Scientist at NASA Ames' [Quantum AI Lab](https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-quantum-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-quail) (QuAIL) and KBR. My research lies at the intersection of quantum information theory, many-body physics, and quantum error correction.

$$\blacktriangleright$$ In Summer 2022, I received my PhD in Physics from the University of Southern California under the supervision of [Paolo Zanardi](https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/paolo-zanardi/). I was fortunate to be coadvised by [Aaron Lauda](https://sites.google.com/view/lauda-home/home) and [Todd Brun](https://sites.usc.edu/tbrun/). 

<!-- Before that, I received my Integrated Master of Science (BS-MS) in Physics from the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar. -->

$$\blacktriangleright$$ Some research areas that I'm currently working on: information scrambling, quantum chaos, dual-unitary circuits; tensor networks and Trotter simulations; quantum error correction (group-covariant codes); operator algebras and fragmentation; quantum algorithms (quantum signal processing, qubitization), quantum error mitigation for NISQ-hardware; randomized benchmarking and unitary designs for qudits; classical shadow tomography.
