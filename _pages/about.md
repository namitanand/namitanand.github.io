I'm a Research Scientist at [HPE Labs](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hpe-labs.html) (HPE Labs) in the HPE Quantum and Emergent Machine Intelligence team. My research lies at the intersection of quantum information theory, many-body physics, and quantum error correction.

From 2022-2025, I was a Staff Scientist at NASA Ames' [Quantum AI Lab](https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-quantum-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-quail) (QuAIL) and KBR. In Summer 2022, I received my PhD in Physics from the University of Southern California under the supervision of [Paolo Zanardi](https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/paolo-zanardi/) and [Aaron Lauda](https://sites.google.com/view/lauda-home/home).

[Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=293966): on the CS side, my academic genealogy is: Alan Turing -> Robin Gandy -> Martin Hyland -> Aaron Lauda -> Namit Anand.

<!-- Before that, I received my Integrated Master of Science (BS-MS) in Physics from the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar. -->
